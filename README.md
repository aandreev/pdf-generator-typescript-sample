# PDF Generator Sample

**TODO:** Add blog post link

Generate PDF files with PhantomJS and Puppeteer.

Provide means for rendering templates into HTML. Use PhantomJS or
Puppeteer to render HTML files into PDF documents.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
- Node.js (prefer versions v8.9.3+)
- Typescript

Base setup was copied from https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter

## Development

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Each library should have types defined. If you are planning to use one without
then you need to create a definitions file in `src/types/`.
Prefer using [dts-gen](https://github.com/Microsoft/dts-gen) for that.

## Testing

Jest is used for tests. Add new test files in `test/` directory.

```
npm test
```

## Production

```
npm install
npm run build
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

## Specificaton

Swagger spec is located in `src/public/swagger.yaml`.

* Typescript models are generated by the spec
* API models are validated by the spec
